Age of Exile is a mod inspired by Diablo and Path of Exile, and aims to provide a new gear progression system that's more fun and interesting than the vanilla enchantments system.

 

This is a Fabric port of a reworked Mine and Slash, but the rework made it compatible with other mods.

 

Current features:

* A Diablo like gear progression system with RNG stats, Unique gears, sockets and more!

* A leveling system for both players and mobs.

* A stat system with many different hack and slash stats, like: Critical Damage, Lifesteal, Dodge Rating etc.

* A Spell system with 20+ spells.

* Nearly all features are datapacks, meaning fully configurable! Make new Unique gears, change affixes and so on.

 

Big compatibility changes from Mine and Slash:

* Damage is no longer overrided. This means other mod's gear and spells should ALL be compatible now!
* There's no magical mine and slash hp anymore, instead your normal hearts are increased.
