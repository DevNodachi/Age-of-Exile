v.1.4.0

Added a few new unique gears:
- Snake eye
- Judgement
- Smell of Rot
- The Unfading
- Fifth Rider
- Harbinger
- Gluttony
- Crown of Ice
- Crown of Elements
- Origin of Arcane

Added new stats:
- dmg at day
- dmg at night

- added gem and rune loot crates.

Reworks:
- perks and spell mods now use efficient packets
- reworked inner code. Might be buggy. Goal: separate my data generation code from actual in game code. Data gen code should never run outside of my dev environment.
As a result some ring and necklaces changed ids
- added datapack effects! You can use similar format to spells and make effects do custom things, or just make them purely give stats, even vanilla ones!
- sync all packets at login again. (there was a problem, spells didnt work until you opened menu, woops)

Reworked my rarities into registries like all my other datapacks, as a result:
- you can now add as many rarities as you want!
- mob rarities are now datapacks too!
