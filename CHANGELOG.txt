v.1.3.0

This update reworks skill gems into skill trees!

- skill gems gone
- added skill trees

By investing points into Skill trees you can unlock stat bonuses and spells.
There's currently 6 skill trees: Fire, Ocean, Nature, Storm, Divine, Hunting.

There's currently no limit to the amount of trees you can invest in, besides the points themselves.

Oh, and skill trees are 100% datapacks. Meaning you can edit or add new ones to your will!
You can go nuts and add a perk that gives 100 health but locked under kill ender dragon advancement.. Or something crazy like that.

This update was quick as most of the hard part was done by me in earlier version. I just removed talents while thinking how to add them back.
It still took a few days though.

Other changes:
- should fix my mobs spawning in light
