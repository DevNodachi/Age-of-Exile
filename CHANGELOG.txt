v.1.3.0

This update reworks skill gems into skill trees and turns spells into datapacks!

- skill gems gone
- added skill trees
- spells are now datapacks
- added skill tree datapacks
- added skill modifier datapacks

By investing points into Skill trees you can unlock stat bonuses and spells.
There's currently 6 skill trees: Fire, Ocean, Nature, Storm, Divine, Hunting.

There's currently no limit to the amount of trees you can invest in, besides the points themselves.

Oh, and skill trees are 100% datapacks. Meaning you can edit or add new ones to your will!
You can go nuts and add a perk that gives 100 health but locked under kill ender dragon advancement.. Or something crazy like that.

Spells were turned into datapacks too, so now you can make a spell that shoots 50 chicken eggs and deals nature damage or whatever you really want.

[WARNING]: As this is a new system, it's prone to changes. I suggest you don't create too many spells just yet but I do wish you try to create one or two good ones.
Reason being is that those changes are likely to break existing datapacks. The situation should stabilize after I get some feedback on the system, fix bugs etc.
