v.1.0.8
- fix nature balm

v.1.0.7

- Changed affix datapacks to require tags instead of specific base gears.
This should make it much easier to add new base gears now!
Before you had to change all the affixes a sword uses for example, to include your custom sword type. 
But now as long as you have the "sword" tag, it should work.
- casting weapon requirements are now also gotten through gear type tags, which means you can modify which weapons can cast which spells now!
- int now gives mana regen too
- updated chinese lang


v.1.0.6

* added help button on EVERY gui or station that needs it! 
It will explain what the block is used for. Should help newbies a lot.
* made jewel socketing more informative
* if pvp is disabled magic shield should no longer bypass pvp checks
* changed buff spells to require any weapon, instead of mage weapons
* reduced level penalty a bit
* upped default gear drops a bit
* decreased default stat scalings

v1.0.5

Backup world before update! I added some code to retrieve the spells from hotbar but it might not work.

* spell hotbar setup is now an inventory, and should be much more intuitive.
* you can now switch spells with middle mouse scrolling! (when pressing R)
* switched to vanilla bows, there were arrow render problems (i think vanilla hardcoded them..)
* spells now correctly require bows or melee (for arrow spells and melee spells) currently only 1 melee spell
* compatible items should now be able to cast spells
* jewels now more likely to drop as a lower level, to allow easier socketing
* dodge now no longer works on elemental damage. It's now in line with armor.
* orb of transmutation now easier to craft
* fixed spell mana tooltips being wrong
* fix judgement effect not doing damage

v.1.0.4

Mod now requires library: Library of Exile

Goal of the library is to try to allow some of the features I make to be playable without Age of Exile.
For example, if I wanted to make a dimension, I could make it as a separate mod and then use my library to add Age of Exile support.
And also to house some widely used utilities.

A separate mod has been created to house my controversial balance changes: Balance of Exile.
This currently contains the enviromental damage check and anti mob farm system. 

This is my first time making a library, so I expect some bugs.

* added new gear type, Holy scepter.
* added a new unique scepter
* fixed leveling being too easy because exp was multiplied by total mob health instead of total vanilla hp before the added health
* fixed hp rendering so it's accurate (it didnt show lost hp for a while)
* skill gems now salvagable (dont throw them away now xD)
* should fix spell tooltips having wrong levels
* added config for scale mob lvl to player so you don't need to use datapacks for this common complaint
* reworked gear sockets to be less confusing
* added orb of infinity
* player dmg should now be disabled if pvp is disabled 
* made spell tooltips shorter
* optimized mob type detection

v.1.0.3

Trying out a different damage system. Basically:
- I don't change vanilla damage at all, I just add my damage too.
- This leads to all armor and weapons being compatible, just less and less useful as Age of Exile stats grow over levels.
- I'm still unsure if players who attack with Age of Exile weapons should do both vanilla and exile damage.

With this, my mod should no longer be a compatibility nightmare and requiring itself to be the center of a modpack. 
Just tweak max level and stat scalings and you can make Age of Exile gear either mandatory, optional or even weak!

Want Age of Exile gear to be the sole way of gear progression? Up those stat scalings!
Want to balance it with other mods? Tweak to balance it!

* should fix server crashing on spell casting
* tweaked gear drop types, jewelry rarer, staffs more common
* buffed elemental resist affixes a bit
* fix loot not being dropped if player doesnt do the finishing hit
* fix affixes all being same weight (chance to spawn)
* made ele mobs transform their dmg to elemental, instead of adding extra ele dmg. This should reduce 1 shots by a lot!
* magic shield shouldn't be lost if dmg is blocked now
* made stations a bit cheaper

v.1.0.2
* fix horse gui crash
* added chinese translation

v.1.0.1

Added required dependences, sorry about that!

* buffed gear drops
* buffed repair station
* nerf socket chance
* made mob lvls go faster per distance
* gear durability shouldnt go down this fast anymore

1.0

Big compatibility changes:

* Damage is no longer overrided except for item's with stats and my spells. This means other mod's gear and spells should ALL be compatible now!
* There's no magical mine and slash hp anymore, instead your normal hearts are increased.
* Stats scale much slower with levels, and if you want to nerf or buff how strong my mod is, just increase or decrease stat scaling or maximum level. Both work.
* Vanilla armor is overrided for entity damage, but there's a config for effectiveness now.

As a result, the mod should be a lot more modpack friendly while still easily allowing itself to be the main point of a modpack by just tweaking one or two config options.


Big changes that required the rework:

* Spells are now Skill Gems.
* Talent tree is gone. 
* Gear now has local and global stats, local stats are weapon damage, armor etc. 
Think Path of exile 50 base armor + adds 20 to armor + 80% increased armor and the item totals it up.
* Gear rarities trimmed, now Common, Magical, Rare and Unique. Common complaint was that "Legendary" gear was sometimes too weak for the name.
New system doesn't have that issue, the rarity describes how rare it is now, not power level.
* spells are now only casted by staffs (compatible item's don't work for now)
* spell hotbar is gone, choose spell by pressing R and 1-9 and then right click to use it.

Added features:
* generated chests everywhere now have random loot in them
* added many new stats like attack speed, magic find, bonus damage to burning enemies etc.

To rework the mod, I needed an almost clean slate, and to trim a lot of content that I feel wasn't very successful (for the amount of effort it requires).
Other things were removed because I wanted to remove them, but I couldn't because I'd ruin existing worlds (*cough* master bag)

* removed all auto pickup bags
* removed auto salvage bags
* removed charms and bracelets
* removed map dimensions
* removed runes and runewords
* removed sets 
* removed instability

Some of these will probably come back, after a rework. Others are gone for good.

Changed features:
* dimension configs are now datapacks
* entity configs are now datapacks
* damage increases are now totalled up before being applied. (this resulted in some insane damage multiplication)
* attack speed should work properly now
* bows now dont do full damage anymore on short charges
* changed hp regen to reduce saturation by % of total hp regenerated. This means more hp won't cost more saturation to regen.
* made unique gear datapacks more powerful
* gears now break on 0 durability
* runes deleted, jewels used instead. Magic items can have sockets.
* gui changed to more vanilla like. Capped hearts display to one row.
