Reworks:
- further tried to optimize login packets. this time caching the packetbytebuf so it should save at least 0.1 sec per login.
- perks and spell mods now use efficient packets
- reworked inner code. Might be buggy. Goal: separate my data generation code from actual in game code. Data gen code should never run outside of my dev environment.
As a result some ring and necklaces changed ids
- added datapack effects! You can use similar format to spells and make effects do custom things, or just make them purely give stats, even vanilla ones!
- sync all packets at login again. (there was a problem, spells didnt work until you opened menu, woops)

Reworked my rarities into registries like all my other datapacks, as a result:
- you can now add as many rarities as you want!
- mob rarities are now datapacks too!

Some stats are now datapacks!
- "unlock spell" stats are now datapacks, meaning any spell you add, you can also add the unlock spell stat for it too.
This also means the perk "spell" field is now useless, as it's a stat now.

- mobs now have more elemental damage the higher their levels are. Ideally after mid level players should be forced to max their resistances.
I could use suggestions on how to tell players that they WILL be one shotted if they don't focus on their resistances.
There will be builds that don't focus on resistance maxing, but that would require specific uniques.
- added max_worn_at_once to gear rarities. This way you can add rarity specific restrictions. You can even go wow like and make a Mega legendary or something and allow only 1 worn per character.
- fix runewords being allowed on all gear types
