v.1.4.0

- added a few unique gears
- reworked inner code. Might be buggy. Goal: separate my data generation code from actual in game code. Data gen code should never run outside of my dev environment.
As a result some ring and necklaces changed ids
- added datapack effects! You can use similar format to spells and make effects do custom things, or just make them purely give stats, even vanilla ones!
