v.1.2.0

Warning: your gear will have minus durability after this update possibly! 
Repair it first, because any hit will break it. This is because when max durability is reduced, so is current durability..

- removed jewels

- added gems!
- added runes!
- added runewords!
- added socketing station!

Both gems, runes and runewords are datapacks!
Runewords can be added by datapacks, runes and gems currenltly can't. But you can edit them!

Gems are basically the jewels, but stackable and you can craft them into higher level versions.
They're also datapacks!
I have an idea how to add jewels back in, and they'll be more interesting :)

Yes runes were a long time coming. I waited till I figured out a good way to do them.
It's not hard to add them, it's hard to get them right.

Runes are weaker than gems but when matched into runewords become stronger.

Runes are now stackable just like gems and not random. Only the end result of socketing is random (the stat numbers).
I really didn't think of how much of a pain inventory management was until I saw dozens of chests full of runes.

Minor changes:
- fixed server crash on casting spell
- special mob stats are now in entity configs instead of hardcoded
- made gear have similar durability to vanilla diamond gear. I gave it too much it seems
- repair station now sucks fuel only when needed
- added config to show area screen text
- added level distance penalty config
- added golem boss which you can summon same as a wither but: soul sand block > iron block and mob head > bone block.
- you now need material only gotten by the golem boss drops to craft the modify station. 
- added config that by default makes all players count as if teamed (PVE mode basically), disable for pvp servers
This should hopefully stop the bug reports of "I can't heal my friend". But whether i keep this as on by default depends on amount of pvp players.
- fixed +0 exp messages
- stopped mobs from spawning on daytime and made their spawn restrictions like vanilla mobs. So should be less spawns on nighttime too.
- used the proper creative tab code, now no longer replace vanilla brewing tab. Seriously, nobody noticed?
- added new stat, +maximum resistance
- new rarity, Relic! These items have no affixes but can have up to 5 socket slots!
- added bonus exp stat
- fix crash on eating foods with effects on server
- fix death message 
- gear salvage outputs are now configurable! 
- tried to uncap health from 1024 to max int. Experimental as i'm not an expect at reflection.
- salvage station now throws items on ground if the output slots arent all empty. This is to prevent cheating as the salvage results are random
- added new currencies! They can add additional socket slots and turn common items into rares!

v.1.1.3
- fix day mobs config not working
- melee weapon spells can now be used on staffs too
- fix another server crash

v.1.1.2
- fix another server crash 

v.1.1.1

- fix server crash
- fixed spear of judgement missing textures

v.1.1.0 - 1.16.2 update + content additions!

WARNING: This update deletes all existing gear items! 
Unfortunately required because of the gear rework.
A clean start is recommended.

Also, update your library of exile.

This update is actually a combination of a few big updates:
- Crafting update
- Mob Update
- Area Update
- Food update

CRAFTING UPDATE:

All gears now have level ranges, so Old Boots would be lvl 0-10, but Royal boots lvl 40-50.
Each level range has its own material. You can now craft nearly all the gear of any level!
(exception are bows, crossbows and shields, sorry still waiting for fabric api to get those to work)

All gears are crafted with special ores, except cloth and leather armor, which use cloth and leather materials.

Some gears are special, and need a certain Essence to craft. Like to craft a Frost resistance ring, you need Essence of Water alongside the ores.

For a Healing Scepter, you need to fill the crafting grid with Essence of Life, etc.

Crafted items have a small chance to become unique too.
The only thing crafting items like this assures you is their level range and the gear type. 
So you can craft a lvl 10-20 Sword. But you can't be sure what rarity, affixes etc it will have.
Level is capped to player level, so if you craft a piece of gear, it will never go above your level to make sure you can use it. -
(Note, this is within the gear's level range, so Player lvl 25, you craft a lvl 40-50 sword, you'll get a lvl 40 sword.)

All recipes use a very predictable system, so if you can figure out how to craft 1 wand, you'll know how to craft them all.
The only confusion might be rings and necklaces. They only have 2 level ranges, 0-20 and 20-50. So only 2 crafting recipes.

The material needed for the item is based on highest level the item can have.

MOB UPDATE:

I added many new elemental or special mobs to the game.
These mobs spawn during daytime too :) (after a certain level, i set default to 10 so newbies have time to prepare)
World should be a lot more lively now!

Currently there's variations of: zombies, spiders, chickens and slimes!
I also added 2 special kinds of mobs: mages and arcane mobs.
Mages will cast elemental bolts at you and arcane mobs steal your mana.
There's also healer mages that run to nearest mob and heal them!
Mobs that spawn in daylight anger other mobs when you attack them, so care!

Also most ele mobs have resistance to damage of that element :) (50%)

AREA UPDATE:

Each biome is now special and has its own modifiers.
You might get to a Poisonous Swamp or an Infernal Desert.
These modifiers allow my added mobs to spawn, so you'll see nature spiders in poisonous swamps etc.

FOOD UPDATE:

All foods now apply additional effects that scale per level!

- Fish > Magic shield regen
- Meat > Health regen
- Other > Mana regen

Compatibility update:

- compatible items are now always enabled
- You can now pick gear from creative tab, and it will get stats.
- compatible item datapacks no longer specify level, as level is now dictated by gear type
- compat items now get stats instantly when crafted (for some reason you need to reopen inventory for the client to get the data synced tho)
- compat items are no longer added to loot drops automatically
- added auto compat config blacklist for both items and mods, this should be useful for some mods that work mostly on item nbt and aren't suitable for compat


Minor notes:

- reworked stat allocation + stat overview guis into 1 gui
- spells are now each a separate item, to show the actual spell icon for easier inventory management
- spells now work as compatible items, meaning you can take them out of creative and they'll work. You can also make recipes for them if you want.
- made stations much cheaper to craft! 
- added stat that converts phys atk dmg to elemental, used by ele mobs currently
- reworked loot multipliers of different types to stack instead of multiply each other.
- should fix crossbows not doing extra dmg
- added gear slot datapacks. Super tiny, just declares drop chances. 
So if there's 100 different sword types, and 5 axe types, they'll still have same chance to drop if their gear slots have same weight.
- renamed all my packages to my new mod name
- mob affixes now aren't separated into prefixes and suffixes
- you can now hold right click to keep casting instant spells like fireball
- fix jewel crash bug
- lvl 1 common mobs should now have similar health as vanilla minecraft.
- mobs will have less hp on average
- reduced hp regen hunger spending
- mobs now have extra attributes per rarity, like move speed and knockback resistance
- reworked modify station gui to be instant modify with a button click
- increased chance for gear to be higher rarity
- fix nature balm
- level ups now show on screen title messages.
- fixed some texture errors
- added mana burn stat, arcane mobs all have it
- added mana burn resistance
- fix attack speed
- Jar in Jared some deps in my library
- fix typo in mod name of config
- lowered slow scaling of stats (they shouldnt double at max lvl now)
- fix player losing inventory if they die by my status effects (apparently a nullpointer in getdeathmessage cancels the whole bunch of methods)
- added a stat that makes mobs drop more loot if they have it, so now things like mob affixes also give that stat, for convenient balancing
- reworked stat commands to allow level scaling stats too and stat ranges (which are only used for weapon dmg tho)
- added command that lists all extra stats youre given with commands
