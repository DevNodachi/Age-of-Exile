v.1.1.0

Crafting Update!

WARNING: This update deletes all existing gear items! 
Unfortunately required because of the gear rework.
A clean start is recommended.

Now for the good news:

All gears now have level ranges, so Old Boots would be lvl 0-10, but Royal boots lvl 40-50.
Each level range has its own material. You can now craft nearly all the gear of any level!
(exception are bows, crossbows and shields, sorry still waiting for fabric api to get those to work)

All gears are crafted with special ores, except cloth and leather armor, which use cloth and leather materials.

Some gears are special, and need a certain Essence to craft. Like to craft a Frost resistance ring, you need Essence of Water alongside the ores.

For a Healing Scepter, you need to fill the crafting grid with Essence of Life, etc.

Crafted items have a small chance to become unique too.
The only thing crafting items like this assures you is their level range and the gear type. 
So you can craft a lvl 10-20 Sword. But you can't be sure what rarity, affixes etc it will have.
Level is capped to player level, so if you craft a piece of gear, it will never go above your level to make sure you can use it. -
(Note, this is within the gear's level range, so Player lvl 25, you craft a lvl 40-50 sword, you'll get a lvl 40 sword.)

All recipes use a very predictable system, so if you can figure out how to craft 1 wand, you'll know how to craft them all.
The only confusion might be rings and necklaces. They only have 2 level ranges, 0-20 and 20-50. So only 2 crafting recipes.

The material needed for the item is based on highest level the item can have.

Compatibility update:

- compatible items are now always enabled
- You can now pick gear from creative tab, and it will get stats.
- compatible item datapacks no longer specify level, as level is now dictated by gear type
- compat items now get stats instantly when crafted

Update your library of exile.

- added gear slot datapacks. Super tiny, just declares drop chances. 
So if there's 100 different sword types, and 5 axe types, they'll still have same chance to drop if their gear slots have same weight.
