v.1.3.8

Trying to fix login lag further:
- used direct bytebuf packets for compatible items, unique gears, runewords
- skill tree related datapacks are now synced only when you open main hub or skill tree gui.
This should cut down the login lag by a bunch. But might be buggy.
- datapacks no longer have a lang name id field. This is to reduce the size but also because it's not needed.
All of them have a predetermined lang file id based on their guid/identifier

v.1.3.7

- tried optimizing login packets hoping to stop server lag when players login. 
I found some old code and removing it should fix half the lag, but I also cached most of it which seems to speed it up by a lot!
This should only be for cpu time but it seems it could speed it up by seconds. I don't know how much of the lag is from packet size,
if it still lags, I'll have to tackle that too.
- relax some weapon requirements for spells, specifically heals.

v.1.3.6
- should fix golden apple eat crash on servers

v.1.3.5

- Added passive skills! You can only choose 1 of these, and each school of magic has one. 
They are strong, automatic life savers that activate when you are damaged and at low health.
Currently they have a 10 minute cooldown but that's up to change.

- added a "one_of_a_kind" field to perks. 
If name isn't explanatory by itself, it means if 2 perks have "one_of_a_kind": "apple",
then you can only pick one of them. This will be used for my new passive skills but it should be really helpful to modpack makers.

- should fix spell crash

v.1.3.4
Might be unstable due to internal refactors

- fix rare magic essence being a bit too rare. Needs config clear
- added common and magic loot crates
- reworked parts of code internally trying to clean it up, might be buggy
- added starting talent points. Determines how many bonus points a lvl 1 user has. Default 1, so users can now pick their first spell when they spawn.
- fix weapon attack dmg scaling in spells not working. 

v.1.3.3
- fix auto compat items not working on servers

v.1.3.2
- forgot to include chinese translation

v.1.3.1

- fix datapacks not loading correctly on server
- added new weapon icons by catscythe
- chinese translation

v.1.3.0

This update reworks skill gems into skill trees and turns spells into datapacks!

- skill gems gone
- added skill trees
- spells are now datapacks
- added skill tree datapacks
- added skill modifier datapacks

By investing points into Skill trees you can unlock stat bonuses and spells.
There's currently 6 skill trees: Fire, Ocean, Nature, Storm, Divine, Hunting.

There's currently no limit to the amount of trees you can invest in, besides the points themselves.

Oh, and skill trees are 100% datapacks. Meaning you can edit or add new ones to your will!
You can go nuts and add a perk that gives 100 health but locked under kill ender dragon advancement.. Or something crazy like that.

Spells were turned into datapacks too, so now you can make a spell that shoots 50 chicken eggs and deals nature damage or whatever you really want.

[WARNING]: As this is a new system, it's prone to changes. I suggest you don't create too many spells just yet but I do wish you try to create one or two good ones.
Reason being is that those changes are likely to break existing datapacks. The situation should stabilize after I get some feedback on the system, fix bugs etc.
