v.1.1.0 - 1.16.2 update + content additions!

WARNING: This update deletes all existing gear items! 
Unfortunately required because of the gear rework.
A clean start is recommended.

Also, update your library of exile.

This update is actually a combination of a few big updates:
- Crafting update
- Mob Update
- Area Update

CRAFTING UPDATE:

All gears now have level ranges, so Old Boots would be lvl 0-10, but Royal boots lvl 40-50.
Each level range has its own material. You can now craft nearly all the gear of any level!
(exception are bows, crossbows and shields, sorry still waiting for fabric api to get those to work)

All gears are crafted with special ores, except cloth and leather armor, which use cloth and leather materials.

Some gears are special, and need a certain Essence to craft. Like to craft a Frost resistance ring, you need Essence of Water alongside the ores.

For a Healing Scepter, you need to fill the crafting grid with Essence of Life, etc.

Crafted items have a small chance to become unique too.
The only thing crafting items like this assures you is their level range and the gear type. 
So you can craft a lvl 10-20 Sword. But you can't be sure what rarity, affixes etc it will have.
Level is capped to player level, so if you craft a piece of gear, it will never go above your level to make sure you can use it. -
(Note, this is within the gear's level range, so Player lvl 25, you craft a lvl 40-50 sword, you'll get a lvl 40 sword.)

All recipes use a very predictable system, so if you can figure out how to craft 1 wand, you'll know how to craft them all.
The only confusion might be rings and necklaces. They only have 2 level ranges, 0-20 and 20-50. So only 2 crafting recipes.

The material needed for the item is based on highest level the item can have.

MOB UPDATE:

I added many new elemental or special mobs to the game.
These mobs spawn during daytime too :) (after a certain level, i set default to 10 so newbies have time to prepare)
World should be a lot more lively now!

Currently there's variations of: zombies, spiders and slimes!
I also added 2 special kinds of mobs: mages and arcane mobs.
Mages will cast elemental bolts at you and arcane mobs steal your mana.
There's also healer mages that run to nearest mob and heal them!

AREA UPDATE:

Each biome is now special and has its own modifiers.
You might get to a Poisonous Swamp or an Infernal Desert.
These modifiers allow my added mobs to spawn, so you'll see nature spiders in poisonous swamps etc.

Compatibility update:

- compatible items are now always enabled
- You can now pick gear from creative tab, and it will get stats.
- compatible item datapacks no longer specify level, as level is now dictated by gear type
- compat items now get stats instantly when crafted (for some reason you need to reopen inventory for the client to get the data synced tho)
- compat items are no longer added to loot drops automatically
- added auto compat config blacklist for both items and mods, this should be useful for some mods that work mostly on item nbt and aren't suitable for compat


Minor notes:

- reworked stat allocation + stat overview guis into 1 gui
- should fix crossbows not doing extra dmg
- added gear slot datapacks. Super tiny, just declares drop chances. 
So if there's 100 different sword types, and 5 axe types, they'll still have same chance to drop if their gear slots have same weight.
- renamed all my packages to my new mod name
- mob affixes now aren't separated into prefixes and suffixes
- fix jewel crash bug
- lvl 1 common mobs should now have similar health as vanilla minecraft.
- mobs will have less hp on average
- fix nature balm
- level ups now show on screen title messages.
- fixed some texture errors
- added mana burn stat, arcane mobs all have it
- added mana burn resistance
- fix attack speed
- Jar in Jared some deps in my library
- fix typo in mod name of config
- lowered slow scaling of stats (they shouldnt double at max lvl now)
- fix player losing inventory if they die by my status effects (apparently a nullpointer in getdeathmessage cancels the whole bunch of methods)
- added a stat that makes mobs drop more loot if they have it, so now things like mob affixes also give that stat, for convenient balancing
- reworked stat commands to allow level scaling stats too and stat ranges (which are only used for weapon dmg tho)
- added command that lists all extra stats youre given with commands
