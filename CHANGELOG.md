## v.1.7.0

+ increased default stat scaling by a ton. Should be closer to mine and slash scaling now.
+ Reverted rarities to mine and slash ones. That means epic, legendary and mythic are back! I also added antique rarity.
Antiques are basically easier to get but worse relics.
+ compatible item datapack customization fields are now optional and have defaults
+ compatible item now uses gear rarity group datapacks instead of min and max rarity rank fields. 
The ranks were confusing, so they're gone. Now each rarity can tell if some other rarity is a higher version of itself or not.
The default if it's not inputted is all rarities besides unique.
+ durability tooltip now says unbreakable if item is unbreakable.
+ added more hp to npcs and less to animals. You don't have to spend so much effort slaughtering cows now.
+ gear name tooltips are now on 2 lines sometimes to reduce tooltip length
+ new affixes: magic find/item quantity affixes on jewelry and more.
+ spawner blocks now drop loot when mined! Apparently the stick doesn't work good enough, so I'm bringing carrots too.
