### v.1.7.0

+ Reverted rarities to mine and slash ones. That means epic, legendary and mythic are back! I also added antique rarity.
Antiques are basically easier to get but worse relics.
+ compatible item datapack customization fields are now optional and have defaults
+ compatible item now uses gear rarity group datapacks instead of min and max rarity rank fields. 
The ranks were confusing so they're gone. Now each rarity can tell if some other rarity is a higher version of itself or not.
The default if it's not inputted is all rarities besides unique.
+ durability tooltip now says unbrekable if item is unbreakable.
+ added more hp to npcs and less to animals
+ gear name tooltips are now on 2 lines sometimes to reduce tooltip length
